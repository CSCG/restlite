# RestLite.js
A JavaScript Microframework to make Single Page Applications (SPAs) using RESTful APIs

### Getting started
To use restlite.js you simply need to add it in your HTML page :

```
<script src="js/restlite.min.js"></script>
```

Then you should create another js file for example *app.js* in which you will configure your routes and make your REST calls.
This script should be referenced after the restlite one :

```
<script src="js/restlite.min.js"></script>
<script src="js/app.js"></script>
```

Once it's done, you're ready to go !

### How to use it
(coming soon)

### Compatibility
RestLite.js is using HTML5 `history.pushState()` which is **not compatible with IE 9 and older** versions
